	<td>Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia (and Terra in some works of science fiction) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life.
	<p>The earliest life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth's biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet are extinct,Earth is currently home to 10â€“14 million species of life, including over 7.3 billion humans who depend upon its biosphere and minerals. Earth's human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.</p>
	<p>According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was formed around four and a half billion years ago. Within its first billion years, life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms and causing the formation of the atmosphere's ozone layer. This layer and the geomagnetic field blocked the most life-threatening parts of the Sun's radiation, so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve.</p>

	<h3>Top 3 Earth Facts</h3>
	<ol>
	<li>The Earths Rotation is gradually slowing!</li>
	<li>A year isn't exactly 365 days (365.2564 mean solar days), and the earth doesn't take 24 hours to rotate actually 23h 56m 4.09053083288s </li>
	<li>70.8% of the Earth's surface is covered by water, with only 2.5% being fresh water and most of that (68.7%) is frozen at the polar ice caps</li>
